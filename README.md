# 🧠 Detecting Medical Abnormalities

## 📌 Overview
The **Detecting Medical Abnormalities** project aims to build a machine learning pipeline capable of identifying irregularities in medical data — such as abnormal lab test results, radiology image patterns, or physiological signal deviations.  
By leveraging data analytics, feature extraction, and predictive modeling, this system helps clinicians and healthcare providers detect early warning signs, reduce diagnostic delays, and improve patient outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect anomalies in patient medical data using AI models.  
- Identify high-risk cases early based on abnormal trends.  
- Automate alert generation for potential diagnostic follow-up.  
- Improve accuracy and efficiency of clinical decision-making.
